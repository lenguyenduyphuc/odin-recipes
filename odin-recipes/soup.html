        My boss brought this soup to the office one fine day and I was hooked on it from the first taste. It is a snap to make and the flavors are mild, yet very distinct. My kids loved it the first time <br/>
        I made it at home and it instantly became known as 'Tim Perry's Soup.' You might like a stronger curry flavour or a creamier soup, so adjust the seasonings to your taste. It's ready within the hour, but the longer it simmers the better the flavor. Serve with crusty bread and butter.
